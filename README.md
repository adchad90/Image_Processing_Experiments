## 1. Basic Image Manipulations and Transformations

**Description:** This experiment focuses on setting up the necessary image processing libraries in a Python environment (like NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV/scikit-image). It includes performing core operations such as reading, displaying, and writing images, along with simple transformations like resizing, rotation, and changing color spaces.

## 2. Histogram Display and Equalization

**Description:** This program demonstrates the creation and visualization of an image's histogram, which shows the distribution of pixel intensities. The main goal is to implement **Histogram Equalization**, a technique used to stretch the intensity range, thereby enhancing the contrast of the image.

## 3. Linear and Non-Linear Filtering for Noise Smoothing

**Description:** This experiment explores different methods for reducing noise in an image. It includes implementing **linear filters** (such as the Mean/Averaging filter) and **non-linear filters** (such as the Median filter). The primary objective is to smooth the image while preserving edges as much as possible.

## 4. Edge Detection using Operators

**Description:** This program is dedicated to determining and highlighting the sharp discontinuities in an image, known as edges. It involves the implementation of basic **gradient-based operators** like the Roberts, Prewitt, or Sobel operators to compute the magnitude and direction of the image gradient.

## 5. Filtering in the Frequency Domain

**Description:** This experiment moves from spatial domain processing to the frequency domain using the **Fourier Transform (DFT/FFT)**. The code implements and applies various frequency domain filters, such as the Ideal, Butterworth, or Gaussian filters, to perform operations like blurring (low-pass) or sharpening (high-pass).

## 6. Morphological Operations and Feature Extraction

**Description:** This covers fundamental **morphological operations** (Erosion and Dilation) and their combinations (Opening and Closing). It also demonstrates advanced operations like **Skeletonizing** (thinning objects to a single-pixel skeleton) and extracting object boundaries from binary images.

---

## 7. Image Segmentation

**Description:** This is a two-part experiment focusing on dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects. It includes implementing the **Split and Merge Technique** (a region-based method) and the **Watershed Transform** (a contour-based method that uses image topography and markers) for effective image partitioning.
